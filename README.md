# Progressive-Neural-Compression

### [Feb, 2024] We are actively working on this repo. If you have any questions, please contact the first author. The network and the checkpoints are in the `demo_simulation` folder. To train PNC from scratch, please go to `training`.

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code and testbed setup instructions for **R. Wang, H. Liu, J. Qiu, M. Xu, R. Guerin, C. Lu, [Progressive Neural Compression for Adaptive Image Offloading under Timing Constraints](https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS59052.2023.00020), IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium ([RTSS'23](https://2023.rtss.org/)), December 2023.  [[IEEE Xplore](https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS59052.2023.00020)]** [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05306.pdf)] [[RTSS 2023 Proceedings](https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/RTSS59052.2023.00020)]

## Quick Demo
* Install the required environment, mainly TensorFlow and other related libraries (tensorflow-addons, tqd, etc.). We used tf.keras and the code should be compatible with most Tensorflow/Keras 2 versions >2.5 (but <=2.15, as 2.16 starts to use Keras 3), but if it raises an error please consider `tensorflow==2.8.0` (https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/2.8.0/).
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Package versions:** Our edge server use Nvidia driver 510.47.03, CUDA version: 11.6. Python 3.8.8. `tensorflow==2.8.0`. If your python version is not among 3.7-3.10, you may encounter errors when installing `tensorflow==2.8.0` ([more details](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu)).

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keras 3 incompatibility:** In late 2023, Keras introduced the new [Keras 3](https://keras.io/keras_3/), which is not well compatible with Keras 2 and lower versions of tensorflow as of early 2024. This project can trace back to early 2021. The checkpoints were saved with Tensorflow/Keras version 2.8 (Keras 2). The EfficientNetB0 model was downloaded from the API and it was created officially by TF using version 2.5. We cannot guarantee that these models or checkpoints will work on different TF versions, which is common for tensorflow models. If you are unable to use the match versions, and found version compatibility errors, please consider re-save the  [EfficientNetB0](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/efficientnet/EfficientNetB0) and make necessary modifications to the code. 

* Put the ImageNet Val images (named as `ILSVRC2012_val_00000001.JPEG`, etc.) in `demo_simulation\val2017`. There are multiple sources to download this dataset, e.g. from [Kaggle ImageNet Object Localization Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data).
* The demo file is located at: `demo_simulation\pnc_demo_simulation.ipynb`

## Autoencoder Network
We separate out the network, training and testbed into different folders so that user can pick the components they need conveniently. 

The network definition and checkpoint loading is located at: `demo_simulation/pnc_demo_network.ipynb`

```
# Encoder
encoder_input = layers.Input(shape=(img_height, img_width, 3))
initializer = tf.keras.initializers.Orthogonal()
encoder_x = layers.Conv2D(
    16, (9, 9), 
    strides=7, 
    activation="relu", 
    padding="same", 
    kernel_initializer=initializer
)(encoder_input)
encoder_x = layers.Conv2D(
    10, (3, 3), 
    strides=1,
    activation="relu", 
    padding="same", 
    kernel_initializer=initializer,
    name='encoder_out'
)(encoder_x)
encoder_model = keras.Model(encoder_input, encoder_x,  name='enocder')
```

Simply open it with jupyter notebook and run it.

The encoder model `demo_simulation/saved_tflite_models_demo/best_encoder_tuned_model_uint8.tflite` can be visualized by [Netron](https://netron.app/).
