# PyTorch Implementation of PNC
The saved checkpoints .pth saved by the [notebook](https://github.com/rickywrq/Progressive-Neural-Compression/blob/main/pnc_pytorch/pnc_pytorch.ipynb) can be found at [release](https://github.com/rickywrq/Progressive-Neural-Compression/releases/tag/data). The converted model is not tested on the testbeds. The EfficientNet B0 model from torchvision is not compatible for correct classification. Please make sure you re-train the PNC autoencoder.
